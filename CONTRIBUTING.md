# Contribution Guidelines
We are super happy for everyone who wants to participate in this project and improve its quality. If you want to contribute to the project there are several ways of doing so.

## Forking
This method of contributing to the project is **recommended to developers** and users with knowledge of Git and GitHub. If you don't know what is forking or how it works, we recommend you check out this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/nT8KGYVurIU). If you know how to Fork, this should be your primary way of contributing.

**Steps:**
1. Fork the project (in the `Code` tab, navigate to the top-right corner of the screen and click the button that says `Fork`).
2. Navigate to your new forked repository (if you aren't in it already).
3. Make your changes (we recommend you create a new branch where all the commits will be located).
4. Go to the `Pull requests` tab and click on `New pull request`.
5. Select your branch in the `compare` dropdown and our main branch in the `base` dropdown.
6. Finish the pull request and wait for our review.

## Issues
Creating issues is a great way to help our community and is recommended for everyone.

**Steps:**
1. Go to the `Issues` tab.
2. Click on `New Issue`.
3. You can make your issue from scratch or use our `Feature request` template.
4. Fill out the information about your improvement.
5. On the right side, you can assign people to the project and add labels (both are useful for us). Adding the `enhancement` label for features is mandatory and will be automatically added when using our template.
6. Click `Submit new issue`.

## Being a collaborator
If you become our project collaborator, you have the power to directly change the repository. You can apply for the collaborator role in the `Issues` tab with our `Collaborator application` template and/or the `collaborator application` label. In order to use this method, you must know how to use Git and GitHub and have contributed to the project in the past.

## Discussions
Just as with the Issue method, creating discussion is a great way to contribute and is recommended for everyone.

**Steps:**
1. Go to the `Discussions` tab.
2. Click on `New discussion`.
3. In the `Select category` dropdown click on `Ideas`.
4. Fill out the title and content.
5. Finish by clicking on `Start discussion`.
